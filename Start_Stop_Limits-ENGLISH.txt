  less than 40 * С, the heads of the cylinders are not less than 120 * С.
  (During warm-up, zero can be set
  altimeter, reset the meter
  overload, check the voltage of the board
  and serviceability of warning lamps and indicator lamps
  residual fuel).
  
10.Before taking off in order to avoid exceeding the temperature
   cylinder heads open butterfly valve sashes
   and FULLY open the engine doors.
